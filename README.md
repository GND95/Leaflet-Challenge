# Leaflet-Challenge
Plotting and visualizing earthquake geodata on an interactive map using the Leaflet Javascript library.

The software makes an API call to the United States Geological Survey API to retrieve earthquake data from over the past 24 hours. Each dot on the map is an earthquake. The size of the dot is relative to the magnitude of the earthquake. The color of the dot represents how deep the earthquake was. The dots for earthquakes with greater depth will appear darker in color. Clicking on a dot retrieves additional information about the earthquake.<br/>
